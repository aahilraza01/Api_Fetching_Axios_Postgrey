# Api_Fetching_Axios_Postgrey

A full-stack integration that dynamically fetches data from external APIs using Axios on the backend, processes the response, and stores relevant data in a PostgreSQL database. This setup enables efficient data persistence, real-time updates, and easy querying for frontend consumption. Ideal for applications that require syncing external data sources with internal storage

Axios (Node.js) – Handles HTTP requests to external RESTful APIs (GET, POST, etc.).

PostgreSQL (Postgres) – Stores structured data with high performance and scalability.

Express.js (Optional) – Middleware framework for routing and API handling.

Data Mapping – Extracts and transforms API response data before saving.

Async/Await – Ensures smooth, non-blocking I/O operations.

Error Handling & Logging – Includes try/catch blocks and logs for debugging.
